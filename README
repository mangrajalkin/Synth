A simple modular syntesizer written in C++ and Java.

This is a very basic side project of mine. Eventually I may fill it out enough to be a fully
functional program, but more than likely it will remain an experiment.

The GUI front-end is written in Java, using Swing and AWT event handlers.

All the heavy lifting is taken care of through a C++ backend that relies
very heavily on the PortAudio libraries for a cross-platform sound card pipeline.

The only dependancies are PortAudio and a JDK.

PortAudio is fairly easy to include and link against in Windows and Linux.

Before running make, you MUST set a JDKHOME environment variable pointing to your JDK.
